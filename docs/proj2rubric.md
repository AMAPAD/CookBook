|Docs: why: docs tell a story, motivate the whole thing, deliver a punchline that makes you want to rush out and use the thing|3|In readme. [tbd:motivation stuff] https://github.com/yzhu27/CookBook#what-is-c-o-o-k-b-o-o-k-
|Docs: short video, animated, hosted on your repo. That convinces people why they want to work on your code.|3|[tbd]
|Use of version control tools|3|Used git, branches. https://github.com/yzhu27/CookBook
|Test cases exist|dozens of tests and those test cases are more than 30% of the code base|3|https://github.com/yzhu27/CookBook/tree/main/tests
|Test cases are routinely executed|E.g. travis-com.com or github actions or something|[tbd]
|The files CONTRIBUTING.md lists coding standards and lots of tips on how to extend the system without screwing things up|3|https://github.com/yzhu27/CookBook/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md
|Issues are discussed before they are closed|even if you discuss in slack, need a sumamry statement here|

|Test cases: a large proportion of the issues related to handling failing cases.|3|https://github.com/yzhu27/CookBook/issues|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools: everyone can get to all tools and files|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. config files in the repo, updated by lots of different people)|
|Evidence that the whole team is using the same tools (e.g. tutor can ask anyone to share screen, they demonstrate the system running on their computer)|
|Evidence that the members of the team are working across multiple places in the code base|
|Short release cycles | (hard to see in short projects) project members are committing often enough so that everyone can get your work|
